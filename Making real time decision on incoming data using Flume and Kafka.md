# Making real time decision on incoming data using Flume and Kafka

Learn data ingestion from a source using Apache Flume and Kafka to make a real-time decision on incoming data.



## What will you learn

- Ingesting data with Flume


- Building a Flume multiplexed channel selector


- Setting up a Kafka Channel


- Writing a Kakfa client that persist data to MySQL



## Project Description

Data is everywhere and constantly being generated around us. Using Big data tools, it is possible to ingest, process and make decisions based on data at high speed.

This big data project for beginners demonstrates how to use [Apache Flume](https://www.dezyre.com/hadoop-course/flume) to ingest trading data from a source. While the default data flow is to archive all data to [HDFS](https://www.dezyre.com/hadoop-course/hdfs), Flume is also configured to channel some preconfigured symbols or trading pairs of interest to another processing server using Kafka. All the processed instructions are stored in a relational database (MySQL).

We will use following tools in this flume kafka project:

- **Flume**
- **Kafka**
- **HDFS**
- **MySQL**
