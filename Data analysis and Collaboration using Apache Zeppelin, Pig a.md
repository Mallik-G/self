# Data analysis and Collaboration using Apache Zeppelin, Pig and Hive

In this project, we will talk about Apache Zeppelin. We will write code, write notes, build charts and share all in one single data analytics environment using Hive, Spark and Pig.

**What are the prerequisites for this project?**

- A fair knowledge of Hadoop, Hive, and Spark SQL
- A working Hadoop distribution sandbox (eg. Cloudera QuickStart VM or Hortonworks HDP sandbox)

## What will you learn

- Apache Zeppelin: What it is and how it works


- Installing Zeppelin interpreters


- Running Spark, Hive and Pig code on your notebook


- Writing markdown notes or narrative text.


- Collaboration or Sharing your book with others


- Discuss other notebook alternatives like (Jupyter or Databricks notebooks)

## Project Description

A notebook is a code execution environment that allows for creating, sharing code and its execution, visualization and other text information (like markups). It enables an interactive computing in the area of data exploration or analysis. It is logical to a sharable Grunt shell for Pig, or scala shell and PySpark shell for Spark, or beeline for Hive but with visualization, discovery and collaboration.

In this Hackerday, we will talk about one of this notebook - Apache Zeppelin. With Zeppelin, we will do a number of data analysis by answering some questions on the crime dataset using Hive, Spark and Pig. We will prepare some chart to better represent our results and finally share our results with the collaborative or sharing feature of the notebook.

After this Hackerday, participants will have known what Zeppelin is, gained the ability to install new interpreters, use Zeppelin for performing data analysis, sharing results with their friends or colleagues. Also, the participant will be informed of other notebooks in the data ecosystem like Jupyter or the databricks cloud notebooks.
