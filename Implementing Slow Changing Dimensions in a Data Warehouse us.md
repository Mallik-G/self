# Implementing Slow Changing Dimensions in a Data Warehouse using Hive and Spark

-- Understand the various types of SCDs and implement these slowly changing dimension in Hadoop Hive and Spark.

## What will you learn

- Types of slow changing dimension


- Updates and transactions in Hive


- Implementing SCD 2 & 3 in Hive


- Implementing SCD 2 & 3 in Spark



## Prerequisites

- It is expected that students have a fair knowledge of Big Data and Hadoop.


- Installation Cloudera Quickstart VM.



## Project Description

One of the broadest use of Hadoop today is building data warehousing platform off a data lake. And in building a data warehouse, the traditions left us by Kimball and Inmon is still very much in play.

Why not every one of the legacy rules should be implemented as as-is in the big data platform, the issue of slow-changing dimensions is still a front-burner.

The slow changing dimension of warehouse dimension that is said to rarely change. However, when they change, there should be a systematic approach to capturing that change. Examples of SCDs are customer and products information.

In this hive project, we will look at the various types of SCDs and learn to implements SCDs in Hive and Spark.
